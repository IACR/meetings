 - Bring power adapters if needed. It's the UK; here is a link to [Type G plug](https://electricaloutlet.org/type-g).
 - Based on the last F2F adn the F2F at TPAC 2022, there should not be an issue with space, but please avoid registering at the last minute if at all possible.

Thanks for that! Obviously, Cloudflare, like everywhere else, has some building security rules that you must follow to attend:
